#About

##Export Open Instances 1.0
This script creates a folder in your desktop and exports all open font instances there. It's important to say that e**very time you run the script, it will erase all files in the 'exported_fonts' folder**.

##Export Open Instances to InDesign 1.0
Just like the Export Open Instances 1.0 script, but this one moves the folder created directly to the InDesign font's folder. Note that **it will erase all the files in the exported_fonts folder before saving new ones**. This ensures that you will always be working with the newest files.

##Installation
Put the scripts into the Scripts folder which appears when you choose Open Scripts Folder from the Scripts menu.
